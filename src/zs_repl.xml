    This is the REPL (read-evaluate-print loop) for ZeroScript.
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop

    We accept input from the user and compile as we go along.
    When we have a complete command we execute it, and delete
    the compiled code.

    Alternatively, the user can define functions, which can
    then be composed and executed.
