Problem: REPL shows continuation after fn definition
Problem: how to compile & run a paper script
Problem: define test case for each atomic, in ZS
Problem: period doesn't work for <fn: (sum). fn (1 2 3)>

- repl primitive takes list of lines, executes

- rewrite scaling primitives in ZS?

    - default for * is "multiple by 1"?
    - how to add hint for function....
    k: <Multiply by 1000> (1000 *)

- if input pipe contains any real, tell function this

- pipes can probably be built as single tree structure

- make core atomics work with reals
    - start with whole
    - if we hit any real, then flip to real loop
    - strings...? **for later**

- selftests for atomics

- make zs_repl into an actor
    - accept input on pipe
    - return output to pipe (end of sentence)

- user functions take type of first function

- profile every function, simple counter, 'n top' atomic sorts & prints top n

- expressive constants: 1/2 1:2 2^16-1 1024*1024
    contain + - /: *x ^
    simple stack-based evaluator in zs_lex

help on function
    how to put function onto pipe
    ? xyz

help (xyz)
    get hint on xyz if it's an atomic
    else show code for xyz if it's a function

    -> how do we know to pass a function rather than execute it?
    1. @ before function name
    2. atomic can force this

mark atomics as draft, stable, legacy
contract for every function/atomic

0, 1 many - conditionals and loops are the same; we repeat a phrase N times
