loops/conditionals

0, 1 many - conditionals and loops are the same; we repeat a function N times

    compute { execute }
    sum { echo <*> }

    forever { sleep (1) temperature }
    until (12 PM) { sleep (1) temperature }

    above (30 C) { cooling (on) }
    below (15 C) { heating (on) }

Numbers and units

    digits suffix

    123 K 1 K sum

    should give
    123000 1000 sum

    suffix is an atomic that changes the last value

    ++ 100 200 300 K
    ++ functions operate on entire pipe by default?


    however...

    1 M 2 K sum should give 1002000


pushing pipes
    - when executing function, don't destroy existing input
    - push it and then pop it again
    - our structure is a stack of pipes
    - one thread always writes to one place






    { again }
    pulse ( something )
        - take number off pipe
        - repeat ... times

    [ maybe ]
    then ( something )
