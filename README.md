# ZeroScript

Problem: I need a neutral language for the Guide. C is fine yet too much of a barrier to many people.
Solution: design a new simple ZeroMQ focused language that provides sufficient power to write examples.

Problem: I'd like a scripting language for Malamute.
Solution: use a scripting language that is fast enough for real work and totally sandboxed.
