# ZeroScript

Problem: I need a neutral language for the Guide. C is fine yet too much of a barrier to many people.
Solution: design a new simple ZeroMQ focused language that provides sufficient power to write examples.

Problem: I'd like a scripting language for Malamute.
Solution: use a scripting language that is fast enough for real work and totally sandboxed.

Problem: I need a neutral language for contract testing. That is, writing code to test the ZeroMQ
contracts around libzmq, czmq, zyre, etc. This language has to be multithreaded, minimalistic.

Problem: I need a simpler way to show how ZeroMQ works for tutorials and conferences.
Solution: a scriptable language that works with an interactive shell.
